## About PocketSource

There are lots of awesome resources on the internet. May they be packages, blogs, tutorials, etc. We find it hard to manage these resources. It's important for a developer "Not to reinvent the wheel".

## Solution

We are building a web and a cross platform application to manage these resources. So according to categories / types these resources will be available to us. It may contain a description of the resource as descriptive as a blog or mere a note.
